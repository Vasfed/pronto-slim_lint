# Pronto runner for Slim-lint

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/pronto-slim_lint.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/pronto-slim_lint)

Pronto runner for [Slim-Lint](https://github.com/sds/slim-lint), linting utility for Slim templates. [What is Pronto?](https://github.com/mmozuras/pronto)

## Prerequisites
Pronto, slim-lint

## Configuration

Configuring Slim-lint via .slim-lint.yml should work with
pronto-slim_lint. .rubocop.yml should also be respected but I am not
sure if that is the case currently.
